                <img class="picFrame rightFloat" src="img/ngong_jespa.jpg" />
                <p>Ngong Jespa is 12 years old and a son of a single mother, Lustina, who is a farmer. At the age of about 10 months old, his parents left him with his brothers and sister who also were children to go to the farm. There was a big fire in the kitchen where the baby was sleeping set up to dry newly harvested corn (Imagine a flaming hot camp fire except inside a small building). While the parents were at the farm, the younger ones went off to play leaving baby Jespa alone in the kitchen with the blazing fire and heat.  When they remembered to check on him, he was in the flames. They tried to drag him out of the fire but not being old or strong enough, they could not pull him out. They ran out, cried out to the neighbors for help. When the mother and father finally came home and rushed him to the nearest health Center which was miles away, he had sustained third degree burns. Unfortunately, Health Centers are not equipped to deal with such severe burns and his parents did not have money to take him to a better hospital for further treatment. The father died soon after, bringing any hope of helping Jespa to an apparent end. He has bravely attended school for the past six year and is in class 6 at C.B.C primary school Chucku. It will be wonderful to not only help him educationally but medically.

      <h4>Education</h4>
    <div class="mission2 clearfix">
      <p>Many children do not get the opportunity to go to or finish school because their family cannot afford it. For those who do attend school, most cannot afford the tools with which to study such as ministry-approved text books and workshop equipment for technical school students. Some can’t even afford pens, or notebooks. Those who get to go and actually graduate cannot compete with students around the world who have all these resources including online resources at their disposal and can read extensively on a subject before forming an opinion. In this day and age, it is important that all students read extensively on a variety of subjects and view points as the world is quickly changing and globalizing. Think again of those who cannot afford to go to school at all. This is a terrible handicap for a country.   Imagine a kid without education thirty years from now.  Now, imagine a village of those same kids thirty years from now. Finally, imagine a whole country filled with those villages.</p>

      <h6>Youth activities And Book Drive</h6>
      <p>This is a yearly project we have sponsored for over 10 years to encourage, motivate and support kids and their parents right before the school year. We host games and other activities and at the end give all participants note books, pens, pencils and cash prices that will go towards their education. Sometime the parents participate and take home prices for their young kids who are not able to participate in the games. Check out our Media link for videos: ADD Pictures. Click on the <a href="donate.php" class="button">donation</a> button to make a donation. Please specify Book Drive in the comment area.</p>

      <h6>Sponsor a Child</h6>
      <p>Some of the fun things about our Sponsor A Child program is your kids get to correspond with the kids you (or your kids) are sponsoring. We encourage parents to get their kids involved in raising the funds for sponsorship. Imagine if by the time your kid graduates high school they have already help put another kid their age through school. I don’t know about you but I will be mighty happy!</p>
      <br />
      <p>You do not have to be a parent to sponsor a child. If you will like to sponsor and correspond with a child, please <a href="contact.php" class="button">contact us</a> </p>

Unfortunately, she got in a car accident at the beginning of the summer on her way to buy her merchandize. All the money she had for the business was used to pay her hospital bills. As a result of this accident, she not only lost her capital for business, but also she could not participate as a handball player at the Plant A Seed Youth Activities and Book Drive where she usually wins a cash price and takes home notebooks, pens, pencils and rulers to help with her expenses for the school year.

        <h6>The fate of a student in Babanki Tungo</h6>
        <p>An average, a family in my village makes less than $1 a day. Most households have to save for no less than three months to have $10. Say the harvest was good and they saved $20, they will have to spread this around. For instance: 5-10 notebooks (elementary school), a pair of uniform, a pen or pencil then use the rest of the year to try and make money for school fees ( $30 or more depending on the school). Some schools allow parents to pay the school fee in two or three installments but if they do not finish paying by February-March, the kid is sent home. After this has happened to a student a few times, most of them get frustrated and drop out thus ending their education. Other reasons kids drop out is because of a handicap, like the story of Miriamu born with no arms or the story of Ngong Jespa and Shebom Solange from an accident. It is amazing that these kids keep striving to achieve an education. They deserved your help. Please visit our website and click on the Donate button to help out these kids or Sponsor a Child from our list. Your help of any kind is greatly appreciated.</p>         <br /><br /><br />
      <div class="thinBox">
        <p class="smallText">I love pictures so I will share a little of what I see. When I look into the eyes of these kids I see myself years ago in my little village that was less than 300 people at the time. I was one of the few fortunate kids who knew they were going to go to secondary school (the next step after elementary school). I had dreams for when I was done with secondary school but I didn’t have much hope these dreams will come to pass. Out of my class of about 51 (from my village and surrounding villages), less than 10 of us went to secondary school and about five of us went to high school. Out of these five three went and completed college not including me. (You’ve got to make a donation to find out why I didn’t:))</p>

        <h4>Animals and Trade</h4>
        <p>When we were growing up, my mom and dad always had us involve in some kind of trade or raising animals. We raised pigs, chickens, goat, and cow. This was not necessary to cover our school needs but to teach us to earn a living and be responsible for something. We girls also sold peanuts and donuts (poffpoff or gateau) during the summer and my brothers raised pigs and sold wood. Sometimes we made enough money to help out at the beginning of the school year (in the case of the animals, after a few years). So, I like the idea of giving kids an animal to take care of or some kind of trade where they can learn to earn money and be responsible for something.</p>
        <p>If you will like to give one of our kids this opportunity, here are some options:</p>
        <ul class="leftlist">
          <li>2 Goats: $100.00</li>
          <li> 2 Pigs: $120.00</li>
          <li>1 cow: $300.00</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Click on our <a href="donate.php"><b>Donation</b></a> link to make a donation. Please specify which animal and the kid (if any) you are interested in giving this opportunity to. </p>

        <h4>Clean Water</h4>

        <p>Most third world countries do not have clean water sources, causing illness and untimely death. It is important that communities be taught proper techniques that will help provide clean water or given equipment and financial support that will enable sustainable clean water sources. We believe that every school should have a source of clean water. Every child deserves to be disease free and if they cannot get clean water at home let them get a chance to have it at school. They can take some home to their family so the rest of their family can have some clean water to drink as well.  This saves the child from having to walk additional miles to get clean water after walking to and back from school.</p>
        <br />
        <p class="smallText">*Our long term goal is also to bring clean water to communities.</p>
        <br />
        <h6>So far we have raised a total of $940 of the $5000 needed. Please help us bring clean water to these kids.</h6>

        <h4>Sports</h4>
        <p>Sports are activities that unite. Plant A Seed strongly encourages sports activities in schools and communities, especially among young people as a tool to help them learn to work together towards a common goal.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Right now our sports program takes place in Sabga- Cameroon and also here in Southern California with Immigrant Youths from across Africa and South America.  In Cameroon, we organize Youth Sports Activities to give the kids in the village an opportunity to earn some school books and fees while doing something fun. This program usually cost $1000 and up.  Contact us if you will like to Sponsor an activity in a village in Cameroon. We can decide the Village or You can.</p>
        <br />
        <p> It is commonly said that, “work without play makes Jack a dull boy”. It is in this spirit that we try to incorporate sports into our educational program. </p>

        <h3>Cameroon Update</h3> 
        <img class="picFrame leftFloat"  src="img/cameroon-kids.jpg" />
        <p>Plant A Seed has been working with communities in Cameroon for more than ten years. Our current project involves building a clean water well for Alfred and Sarah Bilingual Academy in the South Region of Cameroon. If you&apos;re interested in learning about upcoming trips, fundraising opportunities and volunteering, contact us on our website: <a href="contact.php" class="button">Contact</a></p>
        <br /><br /><br /><br />
        <h3>Clean Water for Sangmelimae</h3> 
        <img class="picFrame leftFloat"  src="img/clean-water.jpg" /> 
        <br />
        <p>We raised over $2,500 in our campaign to try to get 2000 people to donate $2 each. 100% of these contributions will go towards building a well at the Alfred & Sarah Bilingual Academy in Sangmelima, Cameroon.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Now we are reaching out to other NPO organizations that build wells to try to get them to complete the project and working with the school to see if we can start building the well using the funds we have (the designs they have call for about $5000 to build the well). We are still accepting donations. The rainy season is coming so the well can&apos;t be built for a few more months. We will update as soon as we have have knew information.
Thank you to everyone who contributed and helped to spread the word!!</p>

        <h3>Back To School!</h3>
        <p>Back to School Projects fall under our Educational Program. These projects encourages, motivates and supports kids from poor families in the village of Babanki Tungo right before the school year starts. Plant A Seed hosts games and other activities (funding permitted) and at the end of the activities, gives all participants note books, pens, pencils and cash prices that will go towards their education. Sometimes the parents participate and take home prizes for their young kids who are not old enough to take part in the games. This project typically sponsors 150-200 kids every year. </p>
        <br /> 
        <p>Visit our <a href="news.php" class="button">News & Media</a> page for videos. <b>Our #1 goal</b> for 2013 is to provide note books, pens, pencils and cash prices to at least 250 kids. This day of activities gives the kids a chance to do something in exchange for what they are getting. It also gives them something fun yet rewarding to look forward to during the summer break. Equipping these kids with the necessities for school is the first step towards breaking the circle of poverty and illiteracy.</p>
        <br />
        <h3>Back To School Projects:</h3>
        <ul class="leftlist">
          <li>Summer Youth Activities. $1000 or more needed by July 1st</li>
          <li>Full sponsorship for 10 orphans and kids with single parents under the age of 16 years. $4000 which will cover school fees, all school materials and after school classes. While visiting in December 2012, we realized that these kids need extra help. Their results show that they needed someone to help them with home work and things that they did not understand in class. Each class has over 50 kids and only one teacher. It is hard to concentrate on the ones that are falling behind due to no fault of their own.</li>
          <li>Sponsor a child: One time donation- $300 or more. Long term sponsors- $25- 50 monthly. Donor gets to pen-pal with the child or have one of their children pen-pal with the child they are sponsoring.</li>
        </ul>
        <br /><br />
        <h3>Jespa Ngong</h3>
        <img class="picFrame leftFloat"  src="img/jespa-arm.jpg" />
        <p>He was burned in a fire as an infant and now he&apos;s 12 years old. He hasn&apos;t been to a doctor since the accident happened. At the time of the accident, he didn&apos;t get any major surgery because he fell ill and then the mother had to return to the village. Other than his injuries, he&apos;s a pretty normal kid and the other kids are very nice to him now. While visiting him.</p>
        <br />
        <p>December 2012, he said that his eye is painful and lately has started to bleed. We will not be showing the full image but you can see it on our website. The right side of his face and eye is also very burned. We need your support as we start the process of looking into hospital, doctors or foundations to help provide him with reconstructive surgery.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Money will be used for communication between Plant A Seed and his parents in Cameroon, passport, visas, forms and fillings to facilitate and speed up the process of finding help for him. We are looking at $500 to cover all these for the moment.</p>

        <h3>What Is Next?</h3>  
        <p><b>Sponsor A Child</b> – For the 2012-13 school year, we started with 10 kids. As of today we have 30 kids and it is possible that this number will increase before school starts in mid-September through October. These are children of single mothers, are orphans, or their parents cannot send them to school without outside help (see some the kids below). All these kids are from my village of Babanki Tungo. </p>

        <h3>Kid of the Month</h3>
        <br />
        <img class="thinPicFrame leftFloat" src="img/ngong_jespa.jpg" />
        <p>Ngong Jespa is 12 years old and a son of a single mother, Lustina, who is a farmer. At the age of about 10 months old, his parents left him with his brothers and sister who also were children to go to the farm. There was a big fire in the kitchen where the baby was sleeping set up to dry newly harvested corn (Imagine a flaming hot camp fire except inside a small building). While the parents were at the farm, the younger ones went off to play leaving baby Jespa alone in the kitchen with the blazing fire and heat.  When they remembered to check on him, he was in the flames. They tried to drag him out of the fire but not being old or strong enough, they could not pull him out. They ran out, cried out to the neighbors for help. When the mother and father finally came home and rushed him to the nearest health Center which was miles away, he had sustained third degree burns. Unfortunately, Health Centers are not equipped to deal with such severe burns and his parents did not have money to take him to a better hospital for further treatment. The father died soon after, bringing any hope of helping Jespa to an apparent end. He has bravely attended school for the past six year and is in class 6 at C.B.C primary school Chucku. It will be wonderful to not only help him educationally but medically. If you know any doctors/organizations that might be interested in this case, please forward this to them or <a href="contact.php" class="button" >contact us</a> through our website.</p>

Unfortunately, she got in a car accident at the beginning of the summer on her way to buy her merchandize. All the money she had for the business was used to pay her hospital bills. As a result of this accident, she not only lost her capital for business, but also she could not participate as a handball player at the Plant A Seed Youth Activities and Book Drive where she usually wins a cash price and takes home notebooks, pens, pencils and rulers to help with her expenses for the school year.

        <h3>How you can help</h3>
        <p>We are looking for individuals to sponsor and correspond with these kids. One year sponsorship for elementary school kids is $300 per kid per year or $25 a month; secondary school is $420 per kid per year or $35 a month. These are the two levels we focus on. High school is $600 and college is $1800 a year. All donations are highly appreciated and will help us break the cycle of poverty and provide opportunities and hope for a better future and change in their lives and that of their families. Your help will also save the parents/guardians of every one of these kids money which they can use to buy food, clothes, medicine or support other members of their families.</p>    
        <h3>The fate of a student in Babanki Tungo </h3>
        <p>An average, a family in my village makes less than $1 a day. Most households have to save for no less than three months to have $10. Say the harvest was good and they saved $20, they will have to spread this around. For instance: 5-10 notebooks (elementary school), a pair of uniform, a pen or pencil then use the rest of the year to try and make money for school fees ( $30 or more depending on the school). Some schools allow parents to pay the school fee in two or three installments but if they do not finish paying by February-March, the kid is sent home. After this has happened to a student a few times, most of them get frustrated and drop out thus ending their education. Other reasons kids drop out is because of a handicap, like the story of Miriamu born with no arms or the story of Ngong Jespa and Shebom Solange from an accident. It is amazing that these kids keep striving to achieve an education. They deserved your help. Please visit our website and click on the Donate button to help out these kids or Sponsor a Child from our list. Your help of any kind is greatly appreciated.</p>

      <h4>July Newsletter</h4>
      <p class="date">Friday, July 13, 2012</p>
      <br />
      <p>Hello friends and family, lots of news this month!</p> 
      <br />
      <ul class="leftlist">
        <li>Plant A Seed is officially a 501 (c) (3) </li>
        <li>The Benefit Comedy Show is July 18th, 2012. Buy your tickets no later than July 17th <a href="index.php">click here</a></li>
        <li>We are gearing up for Plant A Seed Youth Activities and Book Drive starting July 22 to August 8th, 2012.</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      <p>Plant A Seed Youth Activities and Book Drive is a yearly project which encourages, motivates and supports kids from poor families in Babanki Tungo, Cameroon.</p>
      <br />
      <p>My name is Ruth Akumbu, The Founder and CEO of Plant A Seed. I started Plant A Seed here in the USA after working with Seek Ye Multipurpose Group - Cameroon for 10 years as the Founder and CEO. Plant A Seed has been in existence since December 3, 2010 and is officially an exempt foundation under 501(c)3 of the internal revenue code. As a startup, our challenges are mainly financial, and that is why I am compelled to write and ask for your support for the Plant A Seed Youth Activities and Book Drive.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Plant A Seed Youth Activities and Book Drive is a yearly project we have sponsored for over 10 years which encourages, motivates and supports kids from poor families in the village of Babanki Tungo right before the school year starts. Plant A Seed hosts games and other activities (funding permitted) and at the end of the activities gives all participants note books, pens, pencils and cash prices that will go towards their education. Sometimes the parents participate and take home prizes for their young kids who are not old enough to take part in the games. This project typically sponsors 150-200 kids every year. <a href="news.php">News & Media</a> for last year’s videos. <b>Our #1 goal</b> for 2012 is to provide note books, pens, pencils and cash prices to at least 200 kids. This day of activities gives the kids a chance to do something in exchange for what they are getting. It also gives them something fun to look forward to during the summer break. Equipping these kids with the necessities for school is the first step towards breaking the circle of poverty and illiteracy.</p>
      <br />
      <p><b>Our # 2 goal</b> is to provide sponsorship for 10 kids. These ten kids are children of single mothers, are orphans, or their parents cannot send them to school without outside help.  Over the past ten years, I have been able to keep one or two kids in school or start them off until someone else takes an interest and decides to sponsor one of them fully. I am looking for individuals to sponsor and correspond with these kids. Learn more about some of these kids and cost of yearly sponsorship on our page: <a href="programs.php">Programs</a> As of now, we need $1000 (an average of $100 per kid) for the year 2012-2013. This sum will provide notebooks, text books, pens, pencils, uniform and shoes for 1 year. </p>
      <br />
      <p>It is hard to put in writing how what we do impacts the lives of the kids, their parents and guardians. Every year at the end of the activities, parents come to my mother with food gifts and sometimes just to say, "Thank your daughter for us." Let me try to put this in perspective for you. An average family in my village makes less than $1 a day. A grade 7 student needs 17-24 notebooks, which is about $10. Most households have to save for no less than 3months to have $10. Say the harvest was good and they saved $20, they will have to spread this around. For instance: 10 notebooks, a pair of uniform, a pen or pencil then use the rest of the year to get money for school fee (no less than $30 depending on the school), maybe a pair of shoes at Christmas. It is no wonder that most kids do not go pass elementary school. This is a good image of what spreading very little looks like. The only thing that shows his a school kid is the blue uniform which is too big for him. His pant and shoes are his daily wear and possibly the only ones he has.</p>

        </tr>
      </table>
      <br />
      <p>Songwe Titus is 9 years old in Class 3 (3rd Grade). His father died a few years ago. Titus is a sickle cell patient which alone is costly for a single mother in Cameroon-Africa. He has three other siblings. We had to step in and help him last year because his mother could not afford to keep both him and his brother in school.</p>
      <br />
      <p><b>Here is how you and I can Plant Seeds of Hope, Change and Opportunity together:</b></p>
      <p>PS: Tipping point amount has been raised. Funds raised above the goal will be used to add the number of notebooks each student will be receiving or help pay school fees.</p>
      <h5>Tipping Point Goal: $500</h5>
      <h5>Total Funding Goal: $2,000</h5>
      <br />
      <p><u>Plant A Seed will use these funds to:</u></p>
      <ul class="leftlist">
        <li>Host a day of Activities for 200 students.</li>
        <li>Give students and participants notebooks, pens, pencils and some cash prizes.</li>
        <li>Sponsor 10 children: Buy uniform, shoes and all related school materials</li>
        <li>Keep Titus in school for the year 2012-2013</li>
      <ul/>
      <br />
      <p><b>The tipping point of $500</b> will enable me to host the day of activities and also provide 2-3 notebooks to 200 students.</p>
      <p><b>When I reach my total goal of $2,000</b>, I will not only be able to provide 3-5 notebooks, pens, and pencils for 200 students, host the day of games and activities for 250 children and parents, but I will also be able to sponsor 10 students for the school year. Above all, I will be able to keep Titus in school for one more year. Videos of last year’s activities can be found on our page: <a href="new.php">New & Media</a></p>

      <h4>June Newsletter</h4>
      <p class="date">Friday, June 1, 2012</p>
      <br />
      <p>Hello friends and family,</p> 
      <br />
      <p>What do you do when you can’t sleep at 3 in the morning?  Right now please walk with me…</p>
      <br />
      <table class="picsWithCaptions">
        <tr>
          <td><img class="thinPicFrame" src="img/bigPics2.jpg" /></td>
          <td><img class="thinPicFrame" src="img/bigPics1.jpg" /></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><h5>Cameroon 2002</h5></td>
          <td><h5>Cameroon 2012</h5></td>
        </tr>
      </table>  
      <br />
      <p>As many of you know, I left Cameroon in 2002 with a burning desire to help out these seven young girls among many other underprivileged in our communities. I look at these girls and my heart breaks into pieces. What have become of them? These were 12-15 year olds whose parents had no choice but to marry them off to the first suitor partly due to cultural aspects and partly because they could not afford to send them to secondary school.  I weep for these girls not only because I could not afford to support at minimum wage while sponsoring our yearly sports program but also because they like must underprivileged girls, got married and had babies before they turned 18. </p>
      <br />
      <p>Why does this particular situation bother me so much? I remember at the age of 9 a girl in my class was pulled out of school and married off to a rich man who already had many wives. Also, at the age of 13 while I was packing my bags to go to secondary schools, my dear cousin was being carried away kicking and screaming into a marriage she had no say in. She was about 15yrs old. The memory of that night still hunts me. I couldn’t help them then no matter how bad I wanted to. So when I got the opportunity, I starting thinking of ways I could change the faith of as many as there are in my community and surroundings. In ten years, I was only able to help a few stay in school and help one almost through secondary school until a suitor came by. She was able to graduate secondary school at the age of 18, giving her a fighting chance in life. Even though we lost touch, I know whatever little seed I planted made a difference in her life but I hurt for the rest of them.</p>
      <br />
      <p>Now, look at the second picture above and see the little children in the photos. Some of these children belong to young girls like the girls in picture number one—girls who don’t have an opportunity, a chance, a real shot of making something of themselves. Many of these girls have never had someone tell them that they can be more. Now, look at the older kids in the picture. When I left Cameroon in 2002 they were the children I wanted so badly to help.  In this picture most of them are at the Plant A Seed Youth Activities not for themselves but for their children. Thus goes the vicious circle. Children who bear children who turn around and bear children without much hope for what the future holds—a future they didn’t get. What will they pass on to their children?  I pray that what breaks my heart will break yours…not only for the young girls but for all underprivileged kids. </p>
      <br />
      <p>Finally, picture a child, someone close to your heart. Now imagine him/her at 10 years of age. Now, imagine him/her 10yrs later. Ten years ago, I left Cameroon seeking for opportunities to help a generation of my friends’ and cousin’s kids from falling into the same dilemma as their mothers. Ten years into this journey, I am faced with the same dilemma but slightly different—it is not for my friends’ or cousin’s kids, but rather their grandkids. This time it cannot wait another 10 years. More so, it cannot wait one more month. Please join me and together we can break this circle:</p>

          <h4>September Newsletter</h4>
          <p class="date">Monday, September 3, 2012</p>
          <br />
          <p>Hello friends and family, </p> 
          <br />
          <ul class="leftlist">
            <li>As of our last newsletter, we are excited to report that over 200 kids and parents are participating at the Youth Activities and Book Drive for summer 2012</li>
            <li>At the end of the games, we will be saving every participant a minimum of $5 on notebooks (2-3), pens, pencils and rulers</li>
            <li>We will also provide uniforms and school shoes for 10 students. We want to thank all of you who donated to make this possible</li>
          </ul>
          <br />
          <h3>What Is Next?</h3>  
          <p><b>Sponsor A Child</b> – For the 2012-13 school year, we started with 10 kids. As of today we have 30 kids and it is possible that this number will increase before school starts in mid-September through October. These are children of single mothers, are orphans, or their parents cannot send them to school without outside help (see some the kids below). All these kids are from my village of Babanki Tungo. </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Kid of the Month</h3>
          <br />
          <img class="thinPicFrame leftFloat" src="img/ngong_jespa.jpg" />
          <p>Ngong Jespa is 12 years old and a son of a single mother, Lustina, who is a farmer. At the age of about 10 months old, his parents left him with his brothers and sister who also were children to go to the farm. There was a big fire in the kitchen where the baby was sleeping set up to dry newly harvested corn (Imagine a flaming hot camp fire except inside a small building). While the parents were at the farm, the younger ones went off to play leaving baby Jespa alone in the kitchen with the blazing fire and heat.  When they remembered to check on him, he was in the flames. They tried to drag him out of the fire but not being old or strong enough, they could not pull him out. They ran out, cried out to the neighbors for help. When the mother and father finally came home and rushed him to the nearest health Center which was miles away, he had sustained third degree burns. Unfortunately, Health Centers are not equipped to deal with such severe burns and his parents did not have money to take him to a better hospital for further treatment. The father died soon after, bringing any hope of helping Jespa to an apparent end. He has bravely attended school for the past six year and is in class 6 at C.B.C primary school Chucku. It will be wonderful to not only help him educationally but medically. If you know any doctors/organizations that might be interested in this case, please forward this to them or <a href="contact.php" class="button" >contact us</a> through our website.</p>

Unfortunately, she got in a car accident at the beginning of the summer on her way to buy her merchandize. All the money she had for the business was used to pay her hospital bills. As a result of this accident, she not only lost her capital for business, but also she could not participate as a handball player at the Plant A Seed Youth Activities and Book Drive where she usually wins a cash price and takes home notebooks, pens, pencils and rulers to help with her expenses for the school year.

          <h3>How you can help</h3>
          <p>We are looking for individuals to sponsor and correspond with these kids. One year sponsorship for elementary school kids is $300 per kid per year or $25 a month; secondary school is $420 per kid per year or $35 a month. These are the two levels we focus on. High school is $600 and college is $1800 a year. All donations are highly appreciated and will help us break the cycle of poverty and provide opportunities and hope for a better future and change in their lives and that of their families. Your help will also save the parents/guardians of every one of these kids money which they can use to buy food, clothes, medicine or support other members of their families.</p>    
          <h3>The fate of a student in Babanki Tungo </h3>
          <p>An average, a family in my village makes less than $1 a day. Most households have to save for no less than three months to have $10. Say the harvest was good and they saved $20, they will have to spread this around. For instance: 5-10 notebooks (elementary school), a pair of uniform, a pen or pencil then use the rest of the year to try and make money for school fees ( $30 or more depending on the school). Some schools allow parents to pay the school fee in two or three installments but if they do not finish paying by February-March, the kid is sent home. After this has happened to a student a few times, most of them get frustrated and drop out thus ending their education. Other reasons kids drop out is because of a handicap, like the story of Miriamu born with no arms or the story of Ngong Jespa and Shebom Solange from an accident. It is amazing that these kids keep striving to achieve an education. They deserved your help. Please visit our website and click on the Donate button to help out these kids or Sponsor a Child from our list. Your help of any kind is greatly appreciated.</p>

        <h4>YBFC Soccer Team February Update</h4>
        <p class="date">Friday, March 2, 2012</p>
        <p>As was promised last month, a monthly report on the status of the team will be provided every month. February has been a pretty good month for YBFC and we hope that March will carry the same goodness. We ended the regular season of our first season in the top flight unbeaten.  We are currently in the knockout phase where under hard struggle, we made it past the quarterfinal stage. We are poised to take on to the semifinals where we left off last year and hope to get past that into the finals and by the grace of the Almighty and our hard work, win the championship.</p>
        <br />
        <p>School started for many on the team and so far, everyone is doing fine. We haven't had any calls for concern in regards to players' education.</p>
        <br />
        <p>As for work, many have held on to the jobs that they acquired at the end of last year and the beginning of this year. Some of our players were workers at the set-up of the Academy Awards and though it was just temporary, it was an unforgettable experience. We applaud all who are making sure that they keep busy and also commend those who haven&apos;t been able to get something to try harder. We are also looking out for opportunities in which we can help one another. We have also been getting some responses from some of the people we gave out the t-shirts to and I am almost optimistic that by the end of April, we will have everything ready.</p>
        <br />
        <p>Last month, at the occasion where some of the team members performed, I can say it was a success as it came as a shock that a lot of the members are very talented.</p>
        <br />
        <p>This is the team situation as of February.  While hoping that the PAS family is going well, we remain yours, YBFC</p>

        <h4>YBFC January Update</h4>
        <p class="date">Friday, February 2, 2012</p>
        <p>Happy New Year (2012) to the Plant A Seed family. The New Year comes with good things as well as challenges. As for the challenges, our soccer team has seen a slight decline in performance as a result to the long holidays. We have tied four out of seven games and only won three in the new season. But we are doing our best to get back on top as we are looking to go pass where we ended last season. </p>
        <br />
        <p>Most of the players have started school and some who aren&apos;t taking winter classes should be starting the spring semester next month. To make up for our players who are away at school, we have recruited a few more players and will be doing the necessary adjustments to the roster in due time. </p>
        <br />
        <p>As regards to work, I am glad to say that more and more of our players are getting jobs. This is gradually eliminating "the idle family" which is very good. Many, though individually, will be attending a Cameroon Group occasion on Saturday the 28th where there will be youth talent showcase. Some members of YBFC will be participating in this showcase.</p>

        <h4>END OF YEAR NEWSLETTER</h4>
        <p class="date">Tuesday, December 13, 2011</p>
        <p>Happy Holidays Friends and Family!</p>
        <br />
        <p>As I watch CNN Heroes highlights, I think of every one of you. You are my heroes! I can’t imagine it has been a year since Plant A Seed came into existence thanks to you. Your listening ear, moral support, time, financial support, prayers and well wishes have not gone unnoticed. We have come a long way in a very short time.</p>
        <br />
        <h5>As of November 2010,</h5>
        <ul class="leftlist">
          <li>We have filed all the necessary documents needed with the State and Federal to legally run Plant A Seed and have been operating since then as a California non-profit.</li>
          <li>Plant A Seed Youth Program in Sabga-Cameroon was a great success. Not only did the youth participate but young women came from miles to participate and took home prizes in the form of books and school fees for their kids. Youths who are not in school took home books and pens for their brothers and sisters. Click on the link to<a href="news.php"> watch the video</a>
          <li>A few weeks after school started, we got word that an orphan girl (Fidasi) who did not get a chance to participate in the games was home crying because all her friends were in school and her relatives couldn’t afford to send her. Thankfully, one of our board members stepped up and took care of her schooling for one year.</li>
          <li>In November 2011 we started developing a project for Immigrant Youth in the USA starting with the Los Angeles area. So far we are working with a soccer group called Young Boys FC. Our goal is to bring hope, change and opportunity through soccer in the lives of Immigrant Youth while helping them become contributing members of the community. Click on the link to <a href="news.php">watch video</a></li>
          <li>We started a “Create-Your-Own” online store with t-shirts, postcards and posters to help finance our activities. With the Holidays all around us, you can gift a gift that gives to those less fortunate. Click on the link to <a href="http://plantaseed.deco-charity.com/shop?pn=1">view the store</a></li>

        <br />
        <p>Hello friends and family!</p>
        <br />
        <p>Thank you so much for your support, prayers and good wishes.</p>
        <br />
        <p>For your convenience, we have uploaded the video of PAS Youth Event in Cameroon on the website: www.plantaseedafrica.org. We are excited to announce that you can now order PAS T-Shirt for only a donation of $15 or more. Do not forget to order for your family members. Also attached are sample greeting cards and other items we are putting up in exchange for donations. With your support, together we will plant seeds of hope, change and opportunity in the lives of kids in Cameroon and hopefully India in the spring. </p>
        <br />
        <p>Here is a little inside to why I (Ruth) for one care so much. While in school in Cameroon-Africa, we use to love the quote, &quot;Give a man a fish; you have fed him for today. Teach a man to fish; and you have fed him for a lifetime&quot;. Our hope is that with your support, together we can give these kids the opportunity to learn how to fish for themselves down the road. The future of third world countries depends on it. </p>
        <br />
        <p>Please consider us your main charity. Your regular support is highly appreciated.</p>

        <h4>What We Do..</h4>
        <ul class="indentList">
          <li>Our current efforts is focused on Cameroon, Africa. Through fundraising events, activities and outside support, Plant a Seed provides financial support for education, sports and community development, working directly with schools, communities and individuals.</li>
          <li>At present, there is a large need for school fees and/or Parent-Teacher Association fees. Admission to school in Cameroon is contingent upon the ability to pay these fees, especially in the secondary schools. Most children and their families are unable to afford these fees to go to school or learn a trade. When they do managed to come up with the fees, they can barely afford the textbooks, exercise books, pens, uniforms, shoes that they need to successfully go through school. As a result, they are left without the means to better themselves, their family or their community.</li>
          <li>In order to ensure quality control, Plant A Seed provides donations only to schools, individuals and communities who have personally written and/or have asked for assistance. Charitable distribution is overseen personally by Ruth Akumbu. Those who donate will receive proof of their donation’s impact from the children, school or community it benefits.</li> 
        </ul>

      <div class="mission2">
        <img src="img/aboutPic2.jpg" class="picFrame rightFloat topMargin" />
        <h4>How we started...</h4>
        <p>In 2001, friends, colleagues and I created the Seek Ye Multipurpose Group in our home, Cameroon, Africa. Our grass roots mission was to provide: </p>
        <ul class="indentList">
          <li>Financial support of kids in less-fortunate communities</li>
          <li>Outreach and exposure to subjects such as clean water, AIDS, and education</li>
          <li>Sponsored sporting events for young people in communities and schools</li>
          <li>Financial, educational and material support of women, particularly single mothers and uneducated/under-educated children in learning a trade or business to better their lives and their community. </li> 
        </ul>
        <p>Working within the heart of communities and their infrastructure, we’ve created a force of over 4,000 friends – interested in bettering our communities and ourselves.  As a result of these efforts, Seek Ye grew into the Plant A Seed Foundation in 2010, a bi-continental organization in the United States and Cameroon. Combining the resources of both continents, we continue to plant seeds of hope and knowledge to grow strong communities in our home Cameroon and beyond.</p>

            <p> Ruth V. Akumbu was born in Bamenda, the N.W. Province of Cameroon in 1977. She left her parents at the age of 13 years to live with her uncle in Yaoundé, eight hours away so she could attend secondary school (junior high and high school). She received her high school certificate seven years later. She also had the privilege of learning French as Yaoundé is in the French-speaking zone of Cameroon. In 2001, she started a non-profit organization called, Seek Ye Multipurpose Group. Her work with this group enabled her to come to the USA where she has been living since 2002 working and financing the group’s activities. She lived in Minnesota for 2 1/2 years but had to leave because of the cold weather and came to Los Angeles where she now works in the entertainment industry. In 2007, she started a production company called Dreams And Visions Entertainment.</p>

On his return from the University in 1994, he observed that computers maintenance was absent in Cameroon. Computers were being shipped  to France for basic maintenance.  He founded Cameroon Association for computer Science and information Technology in 1995 and began training high school graduates in basic computer maintenance and upgrade. The program was a big success. In 2001, he was interviewed by the wife of the Dutch Consul and an article was written by his work in a Dutch Magazine. This lead to his accreditation as a member of the World Summit on the Information Society (WSIS) International Telecommunication Union Headquarters and Palace des Nations Geneva - Switzerland.</p>

        <p>Young Boys FC. A group young men coming together through sports to help one another become better members of the community by encouraging education, good behavior and financial support when need be.</p>
        <br />
        <p>As was promised last month, a monthly report on the status of the team will be provided every month.
        February has been a pretty good month for YBFC and we hope that March will carry the same goodness. We ended the regular season of our first season in the top flight unbeaten.  We are currently in the knockout phase where under hard struggle, we made it past the quarterfinal stage. We are poised to take on to the semifinals where we left off last year and hope to get past that into the finals and by the grace of the Almighty and our hard work, win the championship.</p>

          <p class="brightText2">1. Seeds of Opportunity in a box. Seeds of Change in a bag. Seeds of Hope in a jar. Change for change in a bottle.</p>
          <p>The first thing I noticed in everyone&apos;s car when I just came to America was how much change was just lying around in cars. Next time you get into your car, check on the seats and floor in addition to where you usually put your change. You will be surprised that you have at least a dollar of change. $1 will buy at least one notebook and pen for a kid in Cameroon. So I figured you could plant a seed with your $1. All you need to do is get a box, a bag, a jar or bottle label it with one of the above titles or make your own title and when it is full, donate it to us.</p>
          <br />

          <p>As many of you know, I left Cameroon in 2002 with a burning desire to help out these seven young girls among many other underprivileged in our communities. I look at these girls and my heart breaks into pieces. What have become of them? These were 12-15 year olds whose parents had no choice but to marry them off to the first suitor partly due to cultural aspects and partly because they could not afford to send them to secondary school.  I weep for these girls not only because I could not afford to support at minimum wage while sponsoring our yearly sports program but also because they like must underprivileged girls, got married and had babies before they turned 18. </p>
          <br />
          <p>Why does this particular situation bother me so much? I remember at the age of 9 a girl in my class was pulled out of school and married off to a rich man who already had many wives. Also, at the age of 13 while I was packing my bags to go to secondary schools, my dear cousin was being carried away kicking and screaming into a marriage she had no say in. She was about 15yrs old. The memory of that night still hunts me. I couldn’t help them then no matter how bad I wanted to. So when I got the opportunity, I starting thinking of ways I could change the faith of as many as there are in my community and surroundings. In ten years, I was only able to help a few stay in school and help one almost through secondary school until a suitor came by. She was able to graduate secondary school at the age of 18, giving her a fighting chance in life. Even though we lost touch, I know whatever little seed I planted made a difference in her life but I hurt for the rest of them.</p>        
          <br />
          <p>Now, look at the second picture above and see the little children in the photos. Some of these children belong to young girls like the girls in picture number one—girls who don’t have an opportunity, a chance, a real shot of making something of themselves. Many of these girls have never had someone tell them that they can be more. Now, look at the older kids in the picture. When I left Cameroon in 2002 they were the children I wanted so badly to help.  In this picture most of them are at the Plant A Seed Youth Activities not for themselves but for their children. Thus goes the vicious circle. Children who bear children who turn around and bear children without much hope for what the future holds—a future they didn’t get. What will they pass on to their children?  I pray that what breaks my heart will break yours…not only for the young girls but for all underprivileged kids. </p>
          <br />
          <p>Finally, picture a child, someone close to your heart. Now imagine him/her at 10 years of age. Now, imagine him/her 10yrs later. Ten years ago, I left Cameroon seeking for opportunities to help a generation of my friends’ and cousin’s kids from falling into the same dilemma as their mothers. Ten years into this journey, I am faced with the same dilemma but slightly different—it is not for my friends’ or cousin’s kids, but rather their grandkids. This time it cannot wait another 10 years. More so, it cannot wait one more month. Please join me and together we can break this circle.</p>
